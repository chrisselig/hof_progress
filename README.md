# Baseball Hall of Fame (HOF) Analysis Pipeline

This github repo is used to create a data pipeline for collecting historical baseball data.

It feeds the [Shiny web app]() that is used to analyze if a player is on track to make it to the HOF

Most of the data comes from Retrosheet:

     The information used here was obtained free of
     charge from and is copyrighted by Retrosheet.  Interested
     parties may contact Retrosheet at "www.retrosheet.org".
     
The list of Hall of Famers has been scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_members_of_the_Baseball_Hall_of_Fame)

Initial data wrangling has been done by others and downloaded for this project. Wrangled data comes from:

1. [Baseball Computer](https://baseball.computer/)

2, [Chadwick Baseball Bureau](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/retrosheet)
